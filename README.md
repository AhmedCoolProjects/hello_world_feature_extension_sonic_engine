## About 

This extension is a part of the [Hello World Template](https://github.com/AhmedCoolProjects/sonic_engine_templates/tree/main/hello_world) as a **Feature** extension.

It is a tiny extension that uses `scapy` package to extract packets infos from a pcap file.
For now, it's only intended to extract the **src_ip** and **dst_ip** from each packet and publish them as a dictionary object to the dedicated redis channel.
